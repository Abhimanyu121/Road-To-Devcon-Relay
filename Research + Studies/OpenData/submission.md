# Submission for the Labs Open Research Bounty

## Open Data for Open Science

## Project Summary

Public blockchains in conjunction with other decentralized systems can be used to publish and host Scientific Datasets in a manner that makes them more accessible to the public. Removing barriers usually associated with accessing such datasets would allow the public to gain numerous benefits. Besides commercial and educational applications of Open Data a scheme to improve the accessibility of such datasets could be used to democratize research and even allow for easier collaboration and data-sharing between professional researchers.

While centralized solutions to address the problem exist (Data Repositories) it would be interesting to investigate how decentralized solutions could differ from and improve upon existing schemes.
