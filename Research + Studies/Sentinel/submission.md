![](Sentinel-landing.png)

## Project Summary
- Saving Lives: Sentinel is an innovative blockchain-based Suicide Surveillance and Early warning system. 

It allows visibility into the mental health of at-risk individuals by stakeholders, counsellors, guardians etc. without the requirement for explicitly granting access to them of personal mental health data by using decentralized digital identities, sophisticated encryption key management and a system of autonomous smart contracts. 

Innovation: The rules of the system are coded in smart contracts which have exclusive access to the necessary health data. When new information comes in from any of the participants the system updates and makes decisions on whether the risk of the individual has increased. If it has increased beyond certain well-defined thresholds then notifications get sent to the carevigers, legal guardian, doctor, psychiatrist, for example, to signal that further action needs to be taken for this individual  

 This solution is not possible using Web2.0 technologies and there is nothing like this solution in existence in the world today.
