A secure property registry built on the Blockchain can secure billions of dollars in assets and make a significant social and economic impact globally by addressing the rapidly growing demand for transparency and accountability. A Blockchain-based registry also allows the government and individuals the ability to audit quickly. It also allows for substantial reductions in the cost and time required to register and transfer property.
